# 🌀 Java Lambda & Stream API Exercises

This repository contains eight exercises developed for **Sprint 1.08 – Lambdas**, showcasing the use of **Lambda Expressions** and the **Stream API** in Java.  
Each program demonstrates a different application of functional programming, while following a coherent symbolic theme inspired by **fractal harmony** and **Japanese aesthetics**.


## ☯️ Fractal Rendering – “From Pain to Light”


> Each exercise executes the logic required by the IT Academy syllabus  
> while also representing a stage in an inner process of transformation.  
> The Japanese words, fractal concepts, and emotional transitions  
> mirror the movement from fragmentation toward unity.


### 🌑 1. Resonance (Pain / Awareness)
Filtering words containing **“o”** symbolizes awareness — the echo of what still breathes inside pain.

### 🌘 2. Depth (Fear / Resistance)
Filtering words with **“o”** and more than 5 letters explores depth — facing the weight of fear.

### 🌒 3. Flow (Anger / Movement)
Printing with a lambda reflects energy in motion — anger becomes rhythm.

### 🌓 4. Reflection (Solitude / Observation)
Using a *method reference* mirrors solitude — stillness that reveals truth.

### ☯️ 5. Harmony (Acceptance / Balance)
`getPiValue()` expresses the constant circle — imperfection accepted as perfection in motion.

### 💞 6. Connection (Love / Integration)
Sorting by length symbolizes connection — differences aligned into harmony.

### 🌗 7. Transformation (Rebirth / Clarity)
Reversing the order reflects rebirth — seeing the same pattern from a new angle.

### 🌕 8. Light (Peace / Unity)
The `reverse()` lambda closes the cycle — reflection turns into illumination.  
*Komorebi*: light filtering through leaves — peace found within motion.
