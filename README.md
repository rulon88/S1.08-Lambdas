# üåÄ Java Lambda & Stream API Exercises

This repository contains eight exercises developed for **Sprint 1.08 ‚Äì Lambdas**, showcasing the use of **Lambda Expressions** and the **Stream API** in Java.  
Each program demonstrates a different application of functional programming, while following a coherent symbolic theme inspired by **fractal harmony** and **Japanese aesthetics**.

> Each exercise executes the logic required by the IT Academy syllabus  
> while also representing a stage in an inner process of transformation.  
> The Japanese words, fractal concepts, and emotional transitions  
> mirror the movement from fragmentation toward unity.


## Description

The exercises cover:

Lambda Expressions: Anonymous functions that simplify the implementation of single-method interfaces.

Functional Interfaces: Such as Predicate, Consumer, Function, and Supplier.

Stream API: For performing operations like filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing collections.

Method References: Cleaner alternative to lambdas when existing methods fit the logic.

Immutability and Declarative Style: Favoring what to do instead of how to do it.

Each file demonstrates a specific transformation or operation, progressively introducing the use of pure functions, pipelines, and functional composition.
